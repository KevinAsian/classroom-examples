# Codingbat Solution Tracing
This is a collection of [Codingbat](http://codingbat.com) solutions that may or may not work. 
The idea is to trace the code to discover the errors or to determine if the solution is infact correct.

## Adding a post
Simply edit this document and add your code as shown below with the following rules:
1. Ensure your code is within triple backticks like below. 
2. Add [type annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) for the function header so we know what type of data the function recieves and returns.
3. Ensure that the name of the function is under an appropriate `###` header.
4. Ensure that the problem's explanation text is above all the "solutions". 
5. Keep the problems in alpha order.

## Example:
### double
Create a function that will double the given integer.
```
double(5) -> 10
double(3) -> 6
double(0) -> 0
```
Solutions:

```python
def double(n: int) -> int:
    return n * 2
```

```python
def double(n: int) -> int:
    return n * 1
```

### CountClumps
Say that a "clump" in an array is a series of 2 or more adjacent elements of the same value. Return the number of clumps in the given array.
```
countClumps([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]) → 2
countClumps([1, 1, 2, 1, 1]) → 2
countClumps([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) → 1
```
Solutions:

```
def countClumps(nums):
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        count = 0
        num = nums[0]
        visited = False
        for i in range (1,len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == num and visited == False:
                count += 1
                visited = True
            elif nums[i] != num:
                num = nums[i]
                visited = False
        return count
```
End example
